This repo contains the introductory projects for the Advance Computer Systems class at RPI.
The three projects were:
Project #1: SIMD Advantage Profiling
Project #2: Cache & Memory Performance Profiling
Project #3: SSD Performance Profiling

All projects were run on my personal computer.
Code was mostly written by GenAI and was ironed out by me. 
Boilerplate methodologies were generated by AI and then filled in by me. 
Experimental analysis was generated by me, and then formatted into a markdown file by AI.
